# Gender Inequity in Vulnerable Employment  
### An Interactive Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project explores gender inequity in vulnerable employment and its implications for financial systems and institutions. Using modeled ILO employment estimates, we analyze how women are disproportionately represented in vulnerable forms of work across countries.

The goal of this project is to educate viewers, particularly financial institutions, policymakers, and researchers — about structural gender disparities in labor markets and why they matter for financial inclusion and economic stability.

This website presents a narrative journey supported by interactive Tableau visualizations.


## Project Structure

The website is organized into four sections:

1. **Context & Importance**  
   Introduces the relationship between gender inequity, financial vulnerability, and systemic economic structures.

2. **Distribution of the Gender Gap**  
   An interactive visualization showing how gender gaps vary across countries.

3. **Country-Level Comparison**  
   Side-by-side comparisons and gap analysis highlighting where disparities are most pronounced.

4. **Implications for Financial Institutions**  
   A reflection on how persistent gender gaps affect access to credit, income stability, and financial equity.


## Data Source

- Indicator: Vulnerable employment (% of total employment)
- Disaggregation: Female and Male
- Source: Modeled International Labour Organization (ILO) Estimates

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
The data used in this project consists of *modeled estimates*, not raw survey-recorded data. These values are predicted based on statistical modeling and may not reflect exact real-time measurements.


## Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** – Interactive data visualizations
- **HTML/CSS** – Website structure and styling
- **VS Code** – Development environment
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting and deployment


## Key Insights

- Women remain disproportionately represented in vulnerable employment in many countries.
- Gender gaps vary significantly across regions.
- Even where improvements exist, structural inequities persist.
- Financial institutions must consider labor vulnerability when designing inclusive financial systems.
